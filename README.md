This repository is [Experimental](https://github.com/packethost/standards/blob/master/experimental-statement.md) meaning that it's based on untested ideas or techniques and not yet established or finalized or involves a radically new and innovative style! This means that support is best effort (at best!) and we strongly encourage you to NOT use this in production.

# Rook-on-Bare-Metal Workshop

Welcome to the "Rook on Bare Metal Workshop"! This hands on workshop takes you through using Rook to provide stateful storage atop bare metal physical services to containerized workloads. You'll be provided with dedicated bare metal infrastructure (physical hosts) installed as Kubernetes nodes, lab instructions, and an instructor to follow through all the steps.

If at anytime you break your environment or otherwise get yourself stuck, don't panic. Simply take another unassigned lab environment and pick up where you left off. We'll rebuild the broken environment and make it available for someone else.

A run through of this workshop is available from Cephalocon 2019 on YouTube:

## Student Prerequisites

For this workshop, you'll be using a remote Kubernetes cluster so there is no need to install any software on your laptop. When attending, please be sure to bring and have preinstalled:

* Wifi equipped laptop
* SSH client (PuTTY)
* Web browser

While you can be a Kubernetes and Rook beginner to take this workshop, we do expect you to have some basic familiarity with Linux and command line execution including running a text editor such as 'vi'.
